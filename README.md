Constructors and Class Assignment 
Question 1: (30 marks)
You are working on a web application for a car rental company. They want to keep track of their car inventory and rental information. Your task is to create a JavaScript class or function constructor for representing cars in their inventory and another one for representing rental information. 
Requirements: 
1) Create a Car class or function constructor that has the following properties: a. make (string): The make of the car, e.g., "Toyota". 
b. model (string): The model of the car, e.g., "Camry". 
c. year (number): The year the car was manufactured, e.g., 2020. 
d. isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the car is currently available for rent. 
The Car class or function constructor should also have a method called toggleAvailability that changes the isAvailable property to its opposite value (true to false, false to true) 
2) Create a Rental class or function constructor that has the following properties: ● car (Car object): The car that has been rented. 
● renterName (string): The name of the person who rented the car. ● rentalStartDate (Date object): The start date of the rental period. ● rentalEndDate (Date object): The end date of the rental period. 
The Rental class or function constructor should also have a method called calculateRentalDuration that returns the rental duration in days. 
3) Create an instance of the Car class or function constructor for a car in the inventory. Then, create an instance of the Rental class or function constructor for a rental involving the car you created. Finally, calculate the rental duration using the calculateRentalDuration method.
Question 2 : (20 Marks)
You are building a simple quiz app that contains multiple-choice questions. Your task is to create two JavaScript classes: Question and Quiz. The Question class will represent individual questions, and the Quiz class will manage a collection of questions and the user's progress. 
1. Create a Question class with the following properties: 
● text(string): The text of the question. 
● options(array): An array containing the multiple-choice options. ● correctAnswer(string): The correct answer to the question. 
The Question class should also have a method called checkAnswer that takes a user's answer as a parameter and returns true if the answer is correct and false otherwise. 
2. Create a Quiz class with the following properties: 
● questions(array):An array of Question objects. 
● currentQuestionIndex(number): The index of the current question in the questions array. 
● score(number): The user’s current score. 
The Quiz class should have the following methods: 
● addQuestion: Takes a Question object as a parameter and adds it to the questions array. 
● nextQuestion: Advances to the next question in the quiz by incrementing the currentQuestionIndex. 
● submitAnswer: Takes a user's answer as a parameter, checks if the answer is correct using the checkAnswer method of the Question class, and updates the score if the answer is correct.
